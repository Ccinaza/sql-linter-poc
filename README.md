# SQL Linting Proof of Concept (PoC)

## Overview
This PoC evaluates **SQLFluff** (Python) and **SQRuff** (Rust) for linting and fixing SQL files in a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions. The goal: enforce SQL standards and automate fixes for a team of data engineers/analysts. Both tools were tested on multiple `.sql` files, comparing rule coverage, speed, and usability.

## Comparison Criteria:

#### Rule Coverage:
**SQLFluff:** More rules (50+), highly configurable (e.g., `.sqlfluff` has aliasing, comma style).
**SQRuff:** Fewer rules (growing, but basic now—keyword case, indent, line length).

**Verdict:** Go with `SQLFluff` if your team needs granular control and strict enforcement.

#### Install Time and Runtime:
**SQLFluff:** 4s to install (Python), 1s per run. Python—slower on large files (seconds vs. milliseconds).
**SQRuff:** 2m14s to install (Rust compile), <0s per run. Rust—faster, optimized for performance.

**Verdict:** `SQRuff` wins on performance once installed, but `SQLFluff` is faster to set up in CI.

#### Ease of Use:
**SQLFluff:** INI config, verbose errors—learning curve but familiar to Python users.
**SQRuff:** YAML config, simpler output—newer, less documentation.

**Verdict:** `SQLFluff` is more mature and has broader community support and resources.

### Fixing Capability
**SQLFluff**: Mature fixing capabilities, correcting keywords, spacing, aliases, and more.
**SQRuff**: Limited to basic fixes (e.g., keywords, indentation)—still evolving.

**Verdict**: `SQLFluff` for comprehensive auto-corrections.

#### Maturity:
**SQLFluff**: Established since 2020, widely adopted with a strong user base.
**SQRuff**: A newer entrant, less proven in production environments.

**Verdict**: `SQLFluff` is more battle-tested and reliable for production workflows.

### Recommendation
I recommend adopting `SQLFluff` as the primary SQL linter for the following reasons:

- Comprehensive rule set reduces manual reviews and enforces team-wide standards
- Fast install and acceptable runtime for CI/CD environments
- Mature auto-fix support improves dev productivity
- Strong community and documentation for ongoing support

I'll keep an eye on SQRuff as it evolves—it may become a strong contender in the future, especially for performance-focused workflows.
